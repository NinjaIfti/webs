    <p>
        Toyota originally revealed the Supra name in April 1978, selected as a new suffix designation for a longer, wider and more powerful spin-off of the second-generation Celica coupé (above). The model was additionally identified by its A40 chassis code.

        Fourth generation (A80; 1993)
<p>
    The A80 program began in February 1989 under various teams for design, product planning, and engineering led by Isao Tsuzuki. By the middle of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991.
